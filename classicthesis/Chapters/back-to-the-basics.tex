\chapter{Introduction}

In this first chapter we would like to introduce some
important mathematical objects necessary to tackle 
characterization in later chapters. Such objects are the 
foundations for the \emph{Riordan group theory} and 
we would like to describe them from our point of view.
We aim at descriptions that point out why a particular 
concept is important and how it allows generalizations
and further developments. Because of this approach,
our introduction will be longer than traditional ones,
which only collect a bunch of proved results about this theory.

In the first part we enter into the playground, where
we will recall concepts according chronological and
dependency order; in the last part we describe our motivations
and ideas underlying this work. 

So, start the journey!
