\chapter{Riordan arrays: a chronological development}
\label{ch:chronologial:development}

In this chapter we would like to introduce some important mathematical objects
necessary to tackle topics in later chapters. Such objects are the foundations
of the \emph{Riordan group theory} and we would like to describe them in our
words, after a quick review of fundamental concepts, such as sequences,
\ac{fps} and \ac{gf}.  We aim at descriptions that point out why a particular
concept is important and how it allows generalizations and further
developments. Because of this approach, our prose will be longer than
traditional ones.

%In the first part we enter into the playground, where we will recall concepts
%according to chronological and dependency order; in the last part we describe our
%motivations and ideas underlying this work. 

So, start the journey!

\section{Understanding the playground}

We are now ready to show how the concept of \emph{Riordan array} has been
developed, starting from a triangle of numbers that counts
\emph{non-intersecting} pairs of paths to some alternative characterizations
for these arrays.
