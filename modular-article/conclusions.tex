\label{sec:conclusions}

We would like to point out that \autoref{thm:mirror:segment:definition},
\autoref{thm:upside:down:zero:hole}, \autoref{thm:two:mirrored:clusters} and
\autoref{thm:principal:cluster:copy:containment} allow us to build an efficient
procedure, written using the Python language, that builds $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$
inductively without resorting to the hard-way approach, which consists to compute
matrix expansion of $\mathcal{C}$ doing convolutions and Taylor expansion for each column, 
then take each coefficient modulo 2 and, finally, plot the result. Using theorems,
we can build a principal cluster $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}^{(\alpha+1)}$ consuming
a principal cluster $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}^{(\alpha)}$ and acting as follows:
first, place $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}^{(\alpha)}$ on top; second, place another copy
on the very right in the bottom halve of $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}^{(\alpha+1)}$;
third, mirror last copy respect the mirror segment; finally, fill the upside-down
triangle on the very left in the bottm halve with zeros. Such procedure is much faster
and easier to implement that the one written by strait implementation of definitions.

To summarize our work, we provide a study of the congruence $\equiv_{2}$ to the
Catalan array $\mathcal{C}$, both a formal approach to characterize different
regions and an implementation are given. As $\mathcal{P}_{\equiv_{2}}$ is very interesting,
is our opionion that $\mathcal{P}_{\equiv_{2}}$ should deserve interest too because
of its recursive flavor and connection to universal counting Catalan numbers.

We finish pointing out directions for further studies: we would like to understand
how a generalization to congruence $\equiv_{p}$, for $p$ prime, can be proved using
either a closed formula for the generic coefficient or algebraic generating function manipulations;
at last, find a modular characterization of $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}^{-1}$, the inverse
element of $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$, depicted in 
\autoref{fig:catalan-traditional-inverse-ignore-negatives-centered-colouring-127-rows-mod2-partitioning-triangle}.
