\label{sec:conclusions}


To summarize our work, we provide a study of the congruence $\equiv_{2}$ mapped to the
Catalan array $\mathcal{C}$, both a formal approach to characterize different
regions and implementations are given. Even though array $\mathcal{P}_{\equiv_{2}}$ is very interesting 
and deeply studied, is our opionion that $\mathcal{P}_{\equiv_{2}}$ should deserve interest as well 
because of its recursive flavor and connection to universal counting Catalan numbers.

We finish pointing out directions for further studies: we would like to understand
how a generalization to congruence $\equiv_{p}$, for $p$ prime, can be proved using
either a closed formula for the generic coefficient or algebraic generating function manipulations;
at last, find a modular characterization of $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}^{-1}$, the inverse
group element of $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$, depicted in 
\autoref{fig:catalan-traditional-inverse-ignore-negatives-centered-colouring-127-rows-mod2-partitioning-triangle}.
