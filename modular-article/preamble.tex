\section{Introduction}

\noindent Catalan numbers were introduced with this name by
Eugene Catalan in $1838$, although they have been used even before by Ming Antu
in $1730$. Let $C_{n}$ be the $n$-th Catalan number, then the following
table shows the first fifteen element of the infinite sequence 
$\left(C_{n}\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ ($A000108$\footnote{All integer sequences
defined in this paper are recorded in Sloane \cite{sloane:oeis}: keys of
the form $Annnnnn$ refer to entries in that database.}):
\begin{displaymath}
    \footnotesize
    \begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccccc}
        n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 \\
        \hline
        C_{n} & 1 & 1 & 2 & 5 & 14 & 42 & 132 & 429 & 1430 & 4862 & 16796 & 58786 & 208012 & 742900 & 2674440
    \end{array}
\end{displaymath}

A comprehensive manuscript, having origin in $1970$, entirely devoted to these numbers has been recently
published by Stanley \cite{stanley:2015}, where it is possible to find their history,
formal characterizations using generating functions and, finally, $214$ combinatorial 
interpretations.  For the sake of clarity, we report three classes of objects counted by 
$C_{n}$: first, binary trees with $n$ nodes; 
second, admissible bracketing of a string with length $n+1$ using $n-1$ pairs
of curly braces; at last, Dyck paths of length $2n$ using $\diagup$ and $\diagdown$ steps.

It is possible to augment $C_{n}$ with an additional dimension,
obtaining coefficients $C_{n,k}$ defining a lower triangular infinite 
matrix $\mathcal{C}$ ($A033184$): in \autoref{tab:catalan:array} 
we report the upper chunk of that matrix where a coefficient at row $n$ 
and column $k$ can be interpreted as the number
of Dyck paths of length $2(n+1)$ with $k$ returns to the ground, start
and end points excluded -- conventionally, indexes are $0$-based.

In the literature, matrix $\mathcal{C}$ is known as \emph{Catalan triangle} and
it turns out to be a Riordan array. Those arrays forms a family of matrices enjoying
nice properties and, looking at them from the abstract algebra perspective, are a group. 
Formally, a Riordan array $\mathcal{R}$ is denoted by a pair of functions $d$ and $h$ which provides a unique 
characterization for the generic coefficient $d_{n,k}\in\mathcal{R}$, lying at row $n$ and column $k$, 
by extraction of the $n$-th coefficient from the following $k$-convolution:
\begin{equation}
    d_{n,k} = [t^{n}]d(t)h(t)^{k}
    \label{eq:Riordan:array:coefficient}
\end{equation}
Riordan arrays have been introduced by Shapiro et al. \cite{shapiro:1991} in $1991$;
thereafter, in $1994$, Sprugnoli \cite{sprugnoli:1991} pointed out their importance
to solve combinatorial sums.

In this paper we apply a modular transformation to $\mathcal{C}$ which maps every coefficient 
to its remainder respect the congruence relation $\equiv_{2}$: the resulting matrix is 
denoted by $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$ and is graphically represented in 
\autoref{fig:catalan-traditional-standard-ignore-negatives-centered-colouring-127-rows-mod2-partitioning-triangle}.
This is a parallel study of the same modular transformation applied to the Pascal array $\mathcal{P}$,
represented in \autoref{fig:pascal-standard-handle-negatives-centered-colouring-127-rows-mod2-partitioning-triangle},
where a coefficient lying at row $n$ and column $k$ counts the number of subsets
with $k$ elements of a set with $n$ elements, in other words ${{n}\choose{k}}$.
In both pictures, we center the root of the triangle and represent every coefficient 
with a colored dot, using colors blue and orange 
for \textcolor{blue}{\emph{evens}} and \textcolor{orange}{\emph{odds}} remainders, respectively. 

Although array $\mathcal{P}_{\equiv_{2}}$ has been deeply studied already, both because its 
relation to congruences about binomial coefficients and its connection with
the Sierpinski gasket \cite{stewart:four:encounters:sierpinski, sokolov},
to the best of our knowledge array $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$ seems to be fresh.  
Our study takes the long track to formally characterize $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$,
getting back an efficient procedure to build it as a reward: first,
using the Riordan array definition of $\mathcal{C}$, we find different closed form for
the generic coefficient $c_{n,k}\in\mathcal{C}$; second, we prove congruences over coefficients
lying in different regions of the matrix; lastly, we use such congruences to implement a procedure
that builds $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$ inductively. 

To support our work, a bunch of functions have been implemented using the Python 
programming language, on top of the Sage framework 
\cite{sage}: these allow us to table expansion of a Riordan array
resorting to series expansion -- the hard way --, to generate \LaTeX\,code
for graphical triangles representations and, finally, to build $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$ 
in a cheaper way.

This paper is structured as follows: in this section 
Catalan numbers and the concept of Riordan arrays have been introduced, moreover we stated the modular
transformation subject of our study; in \Cref{sec:previous:work} important
results from existing literature about the application of modular
arithmetic to infinite lower triangular matrices are refreshed;
in \Cref{sec:C:precisely} Catalan array $\mathcal{C}$ is formally defined
and some facts about it are derived; 
in \Cref{sec:catalan:characterization} matrix $\mathcal{C}_{\equiv_{2}}$ is taken apart 
in order to reason on it piece-wise; finally, \Cref{sec:conclusions} concludes
with final comments and open questions.

 %In particular, we report a
%fundamental theorem about binomial coefficients, proved by Lucas
%in \cite{lucas:theorie:des:nombres}, and
%how it has been used by various authors to establish new and curious results.
